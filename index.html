According to the DEP in 2012 NYC water contained 2.2mg/L Fluoride and on average 0.5mg/L 
(http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/pdf/wsstate12.pdf)

The lowest published lethal dose is about 71mg/kg Fluoride for a human.(http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9927595)

The average adult weight for humans 20 years and older in 2012 in the USA was

195.5 Lbs (88.67kg) for men and 166.2 Lbs (75.38kg) for women. 
(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/bodymeas.htm)

That means that an average male weighing 88.67kg would need to ingest 6.296g (71mg*88.76kg=6295.57mg) and the average women weighing 75.38kg would need to ingest 5.352g (71mg*75.38kg=5351.98mg) of fluoride in order to be killed by it.

Convert that to liters of water that one would have to ingest in a short period of time,

6295.57mg/(2.2mg/L) = 2861.62 L (how much water did you drink today?)

Here's a story of fluoride poisoning from public water in Alaska

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8259189

It doesn't say how much water they drank, but it does say that the water supply for the people who got sick (nausea, vomiting, headache) had a concentration of 150mg fluoride/L while the control group (people who didn't get sick) water supply had a concentration of 1.1mg/L.

So, while it is true that fluoride is dangerous and can do harm to humans at higher concentrations, the humans of New York with an average of 0.5mg/L in their drinking water have nothing to worry about. And so far that I've gathered no long-term low-dose test has been performed and I can't think of a reason that it should.

It is better for the bottled water companies to have you be afraid of drinking tap water, but check out their fluoride content,

http://www.evian.com/files/Evian%20AWQR%202012%20ENG%20All%20Other%20States.pdf

0.075-0.17mg/L for poland spring and evian (about the same for most nestle water)


http://glaceau.com/media/smartwater_report.pdf

0.8-1.7mg/L for smartWater


So, is the .4mg/L difference between NYC's tap water and bottled water going to have an enormous or even slight effect on your health?

I highly doubt it.
